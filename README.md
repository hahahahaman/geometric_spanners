# Geometric Spanner Algorithms

1. Implement an algorithm that determines the stretch factor of any
given geometric spanner.

2. Implement the algorithm that constructs the spanner mentioned above.

3. Run experiments on point sets in convex position to determine the
stretch factor ratio of the spanner mentioned above.

4. Analyze the results of the experiments and make observations about
the pairs of points that attain the stretch factor.

5. Use the observations from 4. to improve the upper and lower bounds on
the stretch factor.

6. Use the knowledge obtained to design new algorithms for constructing
plane spanners for points that are not in convex position.
